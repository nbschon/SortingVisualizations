# SortingVisualizations
Sorting algorithm visualizations with C++ and SDL.

## Features
This was inspired by those sorting algorithms visualization
videos on YouTube. I thought trying to create my own 
implementation of one of them would be a cool thing to do, 
so that's what I did.

Right now, it's got a visualization of the list, as well
as coloring for important indices (i.e. in Merge Sort,
the start, end, and insertion indices of the current 
merge are colored in) for the following sorts:

- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort
- Shell Sort
- Gnome Sort
- Radix Sort

Other things I want to add are on-screen counts for 
accesses and writes, a secondary window for controlling
the visualization, optimizations for rendering speed,
and, most importantly, more sorting 
algorithms.
## About
Almost all sorting algorithm implementations were taken from the "Data 
Structures & Algorithms" course I'm currently taking. Thanks, Professor Dion!
Shell and Gnome sort implementations were gathered from a variety of sources on the 
internet.

The SDL components, like window creation, rendering the list,
and keyboard input were written by myself, with help from LazyFoo's tutorials.
